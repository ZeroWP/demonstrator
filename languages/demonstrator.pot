"While this plugin requires at least %s, you should update your PHP version "

"switch to PHP7. There are some plugins that are not ready for PHP7 though, "
"so do some testing first. PHP7 is much faster than PHP 5.6. It's also the "
"only PHP version still in active development and therefore the better option "
"for your site in the long run."
