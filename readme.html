<p>A theme switcher perfect to connect different site demos.</p>
<p>== Description ==
This is a theme switcher designed for <strong>theme developers</strong>. When installed, the current site will become blank, the current theme will be ignored and the site will become a placeholder for an iframe where will be loaded different site addresses. 
It will create a bar on top that will make possible to switch between demos.</p>
<p><strong>If you are not a theme developer, you should not install it. It is useless for regular users and may </strong></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>Go to permalinks and setup an endpoint name for this switcher. That way you can can get the website back to normal and use the swither only when the endpoint is accessed.</em></p>
<h2 id="features-">Features:</h2>
<ul>
<li>The possibility to manage an unlimited number of themes directly from an admin page.</li>
<li>The possibility to add an unlimited number of styles to each theme.</li>
<li>Setup your own logo.</li>
<li>Setup your own URL that will wrap the logo in a link.</li>
<li>Display the themes and styles in a grid from 1 to 4 columns.</li>
<li>Setup the usernames for Envato and CreativeMarket referal program.</li>
<li>Short &quot;purchase URL&quot;. The real purchase URL will be hidden in a local URL, so nobody will be able to access the purchase page without your referal ID.</li>
<li>The frame is not closed, but instead is collapsed on top. This actually is a bonus because the visitors never lose the purchase URL and the acces to other themes/styles.</li>
<li>Use the homepage and ignore the full site content, or setup a custom endpoint name.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="todo-">TODO:</h2>
<p>[-] Import, Export and Backup settings(with images/files). This requires a lot of work.
[-] Add an upload field to each style. This may be handy if you want to include the demo data.
[-] Implement custom colors for each category. Currently this is hardcoded for <code>WordPress</code> and <code>HTML</code> categories only.
[-] Make possible to change the text of all elements directly from admin panel.
[-] Add the possibility to ignore the &#39;purchase URL&#39; and favor to a &#39;download URL&#39;. Just in case if you want to provide free files.
[-] Display an icon that will allow to preview the the theme outside the iframe. An alternative to <code>collapse</code>.
[-] Lazy-load items. Right now all themes and styles regardless if they are needed or not. It&#39;s needed to load to load each theme and style just when needed(probably using ajax). Ideas are welcome.
[-] Add the possibility to customize the design of the switcher itself.
[-] Create the styles for price and description.
[-] Make a theme unlisted. This is usefull when you have to show the demo, but you don;t have the purchase URL yet. Example: You submitted for review and the theme should be visible only to reviewer, but not to other users. This will be possible only by using a direct link.
[+] Make themes and styles sortable( in admin panel ).
[-] Do not hide the dropdown if no theme is selected.
[-] Add the possibility to activate google analytics.</p>
